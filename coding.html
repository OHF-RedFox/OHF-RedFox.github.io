      <strong>Book Review - "The Art of Clean Code" by Christian Mayer</strong>
    </p>
    <p><em>June 6, 2022</em></p>
    <p>
      I read this book as part of Project Code, on recommendation from the 
      Python foundation. It discusses how to think about software and efficient
      design, making it a prime book to start with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the book's examples were written in Python, it's driving 
      philosophy is useful in any language. For example, the SOLOMON Project 
      is a massive exercise. To keep myself from getting overwhelmed, I must 
      think about developing only what I need for now.
    </p>

      Even in SOLOMON's early stages, I am thinking about the Unix principles 
      that Mayer summarizes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make each function do one thing well</li>
      <li>Simple is better than complex</li>
      <li>Small is beautiful</li>
      <li>Build a prototype as soon as possible</li>
      <li>Choose portability over efficiency</li>
      <li>Store data in flat text files</li>
      <li>Use software leverage to your advantage</li>
      <li>Avoid captive user interfaces</li>
      <li>Make every program a filter</li>
      <li>Worse is better</li>
      <li>Clean code is better than clever code</li>
      <li>Design programs to be connected with other programs</li>
      <li>Make your code robust</li>
      <li>Write programs to write programs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Currently I am still reading "HTML & CSS - design and build websites" 
      by Jon Duckett. I have also started "Think Python" by Allen B. Downey.
