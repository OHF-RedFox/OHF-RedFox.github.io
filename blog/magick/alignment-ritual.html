    <p><strong>I - Opening the Channel</strong></p>
    <p>
      Stand, facing East. Hold the Wand in both hands, 
      pointing upwards at chest level as if in prayer. Close your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a few moments to adjust your posture and regulate your breathing. 
      Take slow, medium-deep breaths. Your posture should be confident, 
      but humble.
    </p>
    <p>
      When ready, pull down a large white column of energy from the 
      Infinite Above. It should be just wide enough to surround 
      you in pure Essence, and continue to the Infinite Below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the Essence course through you, charging you with
      Transcendent Power.

    <p>
      Hold the wand in your dominant hand. Channel your Magick through 
      the wand to trace a large unicursal octogram before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a moment to build up Magick in the wand. Step forward with 
      the left foot and push forward, releasing your Magick into the 
      octogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      When finished, place your hands over the octogram. Push the energy 
      to the right, shifting your position to the South. Your right foot 
      should be forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should now have one octogram to the East, with a quarter-sphere 
      of energy filling the space between the East and the South.
